How to configure pricing
########################

The pricelist used for the prices sent to Magento is configured on the
Magento Backend.

.. note:: In Magento, the default is to share the prices between websites.
          If you want to have different prices per websites, go to
          `System > Catalog > Catalog > Price` and set the `Catalog
          Price Scope` to `Website` instead of `Global`.

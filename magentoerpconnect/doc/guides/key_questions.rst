Key questions when connecting OpenERP with Magento
##################################################

Installing a connector between OpenERP and Magento is not as simple as
clicking on the 'Install' on the OpenERP Apps.

In the e-commerce domain, there are many use cases which are strongly
domain-specific. Every website has its own set of specific
requirements. As such, the connector cannot include all the
domain-specific requirements in a generic manner.

This document lists the key questions you have to answer when connecting
your applications. The questions link to the relevant part in the
documentation when it currently exists. You can also consider it as a
checklist for your implementation.
